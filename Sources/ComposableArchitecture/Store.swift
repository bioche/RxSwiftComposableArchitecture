  ///
  /// Scoping also gives a view the opportunity to focus on just the state and actions it cares
  /// about, even if its feature domain is larger.
  ///
  /// For example, the above login domain could model a two screen login flow: a login form followed
  /// by a two-factor authentication screen. The second screen's domain might be nested in the

  ///
  ///     struct LoginState: Equatable {

  ///       var password = ""
  ///       var twoFactorAuth: TwoFactorAuthState?

  ///       case emailChanged(String)
  ///       case loginButtonTapped
  ///       case loginResponse(Result<TwoFactorAuthState, LoginError>)
  ///       case passwordChanged(String)
  ///       case twoFactorAuth(TwoFactorAuthAction)
  ///     }

  /// The login view holds onto a store of this domain:
  ///
  ///     struct LoginView: View {
  ///       let store: Store<LoginState, LoginAction>
  ///
  ///       var body: some View { ... }
  ///     }
  ///
  /// If its body were to use a view store of the same domain, this would introduce a number of
  /// problems:
  ///
  /// * The login view would be able to read from `twoFactorAuth` state. This state is only intended
  ///   to be read from the two-factor auth screen.
  ///
  /// * Even worse, changes to `twoFactorAuth` state would now cause SwiftUI to recompute
  ///   `LoginView`'s body unnecessarily.
  ///
  /// * The login view would be able to send `twoFactorAuth` actions. These actions are only
  ///   intended to be sent from the two-factor auth screen (and reducer).
  ///
  /// * The login view would be able to send non user-facing login actions, like `loginResponse`.
  ///   These actions are only intended to be used in the login reducer to feed the results of
  ///   effects back into the store.
  ///
  /// To avoid these issues, one can introduce a view-specific domain that slices off the subset of
  /// state and actions that a view cares about:
  ///
  ///     extension LoginView {
  ///       struct State: Equatable {
  ///         var email: String
  ///         var password: String
  ///       }
  ///
  ///       enum Action: Equatable {
  ///         case emailChanged(String)
  ///         case loginButtonTapped
  ///         case passwordChanged(String)
  ///       }
  ///     }
  ///
  /// One can also introduce a couple helpers that transform feature state into view state and
  /// transform view actions into feature actions.
  ///
  ///     extension LoginState {
  ///       var view: LoginView.State {
  ///         .init(email: self.email, password: self.password)
  ///       }
  ///     }
  ///
  ///     extension LoginView.Action {
  ///       var feature: LoginAction {
  ///         switch self {
  ///         case let .emailChanged(email)
  ///           return .emailChanged(email)
